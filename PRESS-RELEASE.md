Disneyland fastpass exchange, a mobile app that facilitates Disneyland fastpass exchange between park guests.

For Disneyland fastpass users to optimize their park experience by adding flexibility and efficiency to the current fastpass system.

Disneyland Fastpass Exchange (DFE) is a mobile application facilitating Disneyland Fastpass exchange directly between park guests. DFE provides a complete mobile platform allowing park guests to easily see all Fastpasses available for exchange, contact other guests for Fastpass exchanges, locate guests with passes in the park, and securely message them. DFE also provides a way to connect with other guests by gifting Fastpasses. Users can sign in through their Twitter, Google, or Facebook account.

Due to the rigidity of the current fastpass system, guests are extremely limited in the number and timing of ride options.  Park guests with limited time often do not get to go on their favorite rides.  Presently guests are limited to one fastpass per park ticket at a time, and there is no easy way to connect with other guests to get or give away passes.

With DFE, guests are able to get Fastpasses for all their favorite rides at times that work for them. The app enhances the current Fastpass system by giving guests control over how they get and use Fastpasses. Guests using DFE are able to choose Fastpasses at their preferred ride times and exchange the passes with other guests if their plans change. DFE users can also hold Fastpasses for multiple rides at one time. DFE also provides a fun and easy way to gift Fastpasses to other guests. 

DFE Product Owner James Yothers says the app was born out of his own experiences visiting Disneyland and using Fastpasses with his family. 

“Like everyone else, we have specific rides we love but only got to go on once during a visit because of how inefficient and difficult to plan around the current Fastpass system is. I realized that everyone was having the same frustration and wanted to make something that gave Disneyland visitors a way better experience,” James Yothers - DFE product owner

Guests can go to Google Play or the Apple App store and download DFE in seconds to immediately start viewing which passes are available. Users are able to contact other users for exchanges or gifting the moment they enter the park grounds.

Kevin Liang from Poughkeepsie, NY says that he had not gone to Disneyland for years before he used DFE. 

“The lines for my favorite rides were so insane that it was just no fun anymore. I was only able to get one or two fastpasses a day, so it was not worth it. With DFE, I was able to go on the Cars ride 22 times in one day. Score!” Liang says.
